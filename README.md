 Excited to share my latest full-stack project!

As part of my internship at YoungDev Intern, I developed a multi-login system specifically designed for schools. In this system, each newly registered user gets their own unique database to manage their data. Each user also has a personalized dashboard where they can:

✅ Add and delete staff
✅ Add and delete student records

This solution provides scalability and security, ensuring that each school's data remains separate and organized. It was an exciting challenge, and I'm proud to have tackled both the frontend and backend to create a seamless user experience.
